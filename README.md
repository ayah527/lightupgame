## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [x] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:
* [x] A "bomb" button that is generated randomly each game, not a part of the pattern array. If clicked, the game ends immediately.
* [x] A notification when the guess is incorrect. 
* [x] An interval that notifies the user when 10 seconds have passed without selecting a hint as the timer goes.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

N/A, given resources sufficed.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

My biggest challenge was working with the images, something I was not yet familiar with since most of my coding experience is back end. I mainly relied on the resources given in the specifications of the pre-work, reading them in depth. There was also a lot of trial and error involved.
3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

My biggest question is how this deep on the backend, and how the complability between the HTML imports and CSS files work. I think most of my 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I would firstly add complexities to the buttons, such as having them move around. I would also implement a challenge mode, where only certain factors need to be considered (ie, size or location) and the other factors can change. There could also be another mode in which the pattern sequence is based on a word, then the user would need to guess the sequence based on the word.
